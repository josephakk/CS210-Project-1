# CS210-Project-1

For this project, I was tasked with creating a program that would display two clocks. One in a twelve hour format, and another 
in a twenty four hour format. The program also then lets the user manually adjust the clocks by adding hours, minutes, and 
seconds. There is an input validation check to make sure that the user inputrs numbers and not other characters. If the program
receives a character that is not an integer character, the program prompts the user to try again.

I belive that I was able to format my clocks neatly and displayed the information clearly, as well as the instuction prompts for
the user. I found tthis part of the coding process to be the most challanging, adding the right amount of whitespace and '*' 
characters in order to display the clocks in a visible way. I was then able to take what I had learned from this project and 
applied it to my later projects, trying to keep the similar clear and easy to read style. I tried to make sure that there was a
newline between where the prompts in, and where the user inputs their answers. In this way, I hoped to make it easier to quickly look
over what they were about to input.
